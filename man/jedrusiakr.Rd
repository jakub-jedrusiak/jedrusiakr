\title{jedrusiakr: Utilities for Statistics in Psychology}
\description{
A set of tools for quick exploration and reporting. The main part consists of
functions used to calculate basic descriptive statistics and normality checks
(mainly `opisz()` and `opisz_by()`). The types of descriptives reported are
different for different types of measurement scales (nominal, ordinal and
continous). The package also includes a set of functions for autoreporting
(`raport_()`) that take a model and returns an example of analysis
description in Polish. For the time being, the package
and its documentation are written only in Polish.
